Code and 3D models for a robotic arm I developed using Arduino Uno and ESP32 bluetooth module. 

Original 3D Models and information about the EEZYbotARM-Mk2 can be found here: http://www.eezyrobots.it/eba_mk2.html 
I ended up swapping the gripper out for a different gripper which was larger and stronger
